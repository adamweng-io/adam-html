<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a highly disciplined and analytical web development learner with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and responsive web design. Currently advancing through structured training via Angela Yuâ€™s "Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp," I focus on building clean, efficient, and scalable digital solutions.
</p>
<p>
  My approach to web development emphasizes:
  <ul>
    <li>Semantic and maintainable code structure</li>
    <li>Minimalist, performance-oriented design</li>
    <li>Modular thinking for future scalability</li>
    <li>Continuous improvement through deliberate daily practice</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  I apply systems thinking to my learning and project development, consistently prioritizing clarity, logical architecture, and technical precision. Rather than following trends blindly, I assess each tool or framework critically, integrating only what improves efficiency, maintainability, and user experience.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to technical skills, I bring a mindset oriented toward problem-solving, independent research, and long-term scalability. My ultimate goal is not merely to create websites, but to engineer high-performance, future-proof digital ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
  I am committed to mastering full-stack capabilities, starting from a rigorous front-end foundation, and expanding toward backend technologies in a methodical, strategy-driven progression.
